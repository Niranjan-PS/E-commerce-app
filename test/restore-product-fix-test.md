# Product Restore Functionality Fix - Test Guide

## Issue Fixed
The restore product functionality was not working due to middleware interference in the Product model. The `findByIdWithDeleted` method was unable to find soft-deleted products because the query middleware was excluding them.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Query Middleware
**File**: `E-commerce-app-clean/model/productModel.js`

**Before**:
```javascript
// Query middleware to exclude soft-deleted products by default
productSchema.pre('find', function() {
  this.where({ isDeleted: { $ne: true } });
});

productSchema.pre('findOne', function() {
  this.where({ isDeleted: { $ne: true } });
});

productSchema.pre('countDocuments', function() {
  this.where({ isDeleted: { $ne: true } });
});
```

**After**:
```javascript
// Query middleware to exclude soft-deleted products by default
productSchema.pre('find', function() {
  // Skip middleware if includeDeleted option is set
  if (!this.getOptions().includeDeleted) {
    this.where({ isDeleted: { $ne: true } });
  }
});

productSchema.pre('findOne', function() {
  // Skip middleware if includeDeleted option is set
  if (!this.getOptions().includeDeleted) {
    this.where({ isDeleted: { $ne: true } });
  }
});

productSchema.pre('countDocuments', function() {
  // Skip middleware if includeDeleted option is set
  if (!this.getOptions().includeDeleted) {
    this.where({ isDeleted: { $ne: true } });
  }
});
```

### 2. Fixed findByIdWithDeleted Method
**Before**:
```javascript
productSchema.statics.findByIdWithDeleted = async function(productId) {
  return this.findOne({ _id: productId }).where({ isDeleted: { $exists: true } });
};
```

**After**:
```javascript
productSchema.statics.findByIdWithDeleted = async function(productId) {
  // Use includeDeleted option to bypass middleware
  return this.findOne({ _id: productId }, null, { includeDeleted: true });
};
```

### 3. Updated getDeletedProducts Controller
**Before**:
```javascript
const deletedProducts = await Product.find({ isDeleted: true })
  .populate('category')
  .sort({ deletedAt: -1 })
  .skip(skip)
  .limit(limit);

const totalProducts = await Product.countDocuments({ isDeleted: true });
```

**After**:
```javascript
const deletedProducts = await Product.find({ isDeleted: true }, null, { includeDeleted: true })
  .populate('category')
  .sort({ deletedAt: -1 })
  .skip(skip)
  .limit(limit);

const totalProducts = await Product.countDocuments({ isDeleted: true }, { includeDeleted: true });
```

### 4. Enhanced Restore Logic
**Before**:
```javascript
product.isDeleted = false;
product.deletedAt = undefined;
await product.save();
```

**After**:
```javascript
product.isDeleted = false;
product.deletedAt = null;
await product.save({ validateBeforeSave: false });
```

### 5. Added Debug Logging
Added comprehensive logging to track the restore process:
- Product lookup logging
- Restore operation logging
- Success/failure state logging

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Verify Deleted Products Page Loads
1. Navigate to `/admin/products`
2. Click "Deleted Products" button
3. **Expected**: Page loads showing deleted products (if any exist)

### Test 2: Delete a Product (to create test data)
1. On main products page, delete a product using the delete button
2. Confirm deletion in SweetAlert dialog
3. **Expected**: Product moves to deleted products list

### Test 3: Restore Product Functionality
1. Navigate to `/admin/deleted-products`
2. Click "Restore" button on a deleted product
3. Confirm restoration in SweetAlert dialog
4. **Expected**: 
   - Loading dialog appears
   - Success message shows
   - Product disappears from deleted products list
   - Product reappears in main products list

### Test 4: Verify Product State After Restore
1. After restoring a product, check main products page
2. **Expected**:
   - Product appears in normal product list
   - Product is fully functional (can be edited, blocked, etc.)
   - No "DELETED" status indicators

### Test 5: Check Console Logs (for debugging)
1. Open browser developer tools
2. Go to Console tab
3. Perform restore operation
4. **Expected Console Output**:
   ```
   Attempting to restore product with ID: [product_id]
   Found product: {id: [id], name: [name], isDeleted: true, deletedAt: [date]}
   Restoring product [id]: setting isDeleted to false
   Product [id] restored successfully. New state: {id: [id], name: [name], isDeleted: false, deletedAt: null}
   ```

## API Testing

### Test Restore Endpoint Directly
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/admin/restore-product \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -d '{"id": "PRODUCT_ID_HERE"}'
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Product has been restored successfully",
  "productName": "Product Name"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Restore Still Doesn't Work:

1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for the debug messages to see where the process fails
2. **Verify Product Exists**: Ensure the product ID is valid and exists in database
3. **Check Database**: Verify the product has `isDeleted: true` in the database
4. **Test Middleware**: Ensure the `includeDeleted` option is working

### Common Issues and Solutions:

1. **"Product not found" Error**:
   - Check if the product ID is correct
   - Verify the product exists in the database
   - Check if middleware is still blocking the query

2. **"Product is not deleted" Error**:
   - Verify the product has `isDeleted: true` in database
   - Check if the product was already restored

3. **Database Connection Issues**:
   - Verify MongoDB connection is active
   - Check for any database errors in server logs

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. ✅ **Deleted Products Page**: Shows all soft-deleted products correctly
2. ✅ **Restore Button**: Works and restores products successfully
3. ✅ **SweetAlert Integration**: Beautiful confirmation and success dialogs
4. ✅ **Data Integrity**: Products restore with all original data intact
5. ✅ **UI Updates**: Products move between lists correctly
6. ✅ **No Breaking Changes**: All other functionality remains intact

## Database Verification

To manually verify the fix works, you can check the database directly:

### Before Restore:
```javascript
db.products.findOne({_id: ObjectId("PRODUCT_ID")})
// Should show: { isDeleted: true, deletedAt: ISODate(...), ... }
```

### After Restore:
```javascript
db.products.findOne({_id: ObjectId("PRODUCT_ID")})
// Should show: { isDeleted: false, deletedAt: null, ... }
```

## Summary

The restore functionality is now fixed and should work correctly. The key changes were:

1. **Middleware Enhancement**: Added `includeDeleted` option to bypass soft-delete filtering
2. **Method Fixes**: Updated all methods that need to access deleted products
3. **Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
4. **Data Handling**: Improved how `deletedAt` field is managed

The restore feature now provides a complete soft-delete/restore cycle with proper data safety and user feedback.
